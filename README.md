# EDA
This notebook provides general overview of dataset and further look into important variables. It identifies time series trends to further investigate.
# Modeling
Swire Modeling: This is the initial modeling notebook that begins iterating on the Prophet time series model to create a prediction that aligns with our goal of having an anomalous amount of maitenance time flag in the model
Time Series Modeling: This looks at using different types of time series models to create a more accurate prediction. It also looks into the data as a whole to ensure it is a good fit for time series modeling.
Final Swire Modeling: This uses the best fit model drilling down into the line and correlated equipment.
